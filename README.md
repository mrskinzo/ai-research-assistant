AI Research Assistant
Multi agent AI system that turns a plain language question into a structured research plan, calls trusted web sources, and returns a cited summary plus links so users can quickly verify and dive deeper. Built with Claude and Tavily, with agents for planning, searching, summarizing, and quality checking.

What it does
Takes an open ended question (for example, “Compare income driven repayment options for federal student loans in the US”).
Breaks it into a research plan with subquestions and search targets.
Uses Tavily to pull in up to date, reputable sources.
Synthesizes a concise answer with inline citations and a list of sources for manual review.

Who it is for
Students and self‑learners doing background research.
Product managers and analysts who need a fast first pass on a topic.
